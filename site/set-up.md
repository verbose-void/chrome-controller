     <p>Getting set up with Chrome Controller can be done in 3 easy steps.</p>
</header>

1. Acquire a controller that is compatible with Gamepad API. The good news is it supports over 1,000 controllers. Chrome Controller has the best support available for Xbox/PlayStation controllers, however you can still customize button mappings for any 3rd party controller. <b>View an exhaustive list of supported controllers <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="{{ site.supported_controllers_url | absolute_url }}">here</a></b>.

2. Before adding Chrome Controller to your browser, <b>test that your controller is detected by the Gamepad API <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="{{ site.test_controllers_url | absolute_url }}">here</a></b> with no download/installation required.

3. <b><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="{{ site.webstore_download_url | absolute_url }}">Add Chrome Controller to your browser</a></b>, sit back and relax!
